Reflection: 

During the time I was working on this project, one of my team members were gone 
for a long time, but as for my other member we worked on the project, but I was doing most of the 
work for the entire team. But overall, I had lots of fun working on this project, simply because
I love working with technology and working with my other partner when he did do work. But it was fun.
